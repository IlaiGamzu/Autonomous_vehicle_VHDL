-  This project deals with VHDL programming- I was a head of vehicle propulsion and tracks on Altera DE2 Board, and you can see the code of the tracks that the car moves on 
   them.
   There are four tracks: 1. circular 2. rectangle 3. backward- forward 4.hands-control, and for each track has a state machine that the output of them connects to the mux 
   that chooses the current track according to the user's input.
