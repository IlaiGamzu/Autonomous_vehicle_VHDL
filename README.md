# Auto- Vehicle

-  This project deals with VHDL programming.
-   I was a head of vehicle propulsion and tracks
-   The Board that we work on it: Altera DE2.
-   My mission was to cause the car to move in four tracks:
    1. circular
    2. rectangle
    3. backward- forward
    4. hands-control,
    for each track has a state machine that the output of them connects to the mux that chooses the current track according to the user's input.
